# Information 
This is a patched version of PlaceholderAPI made specifically for [Papyrus](https://github.com/StumpStudio/Papyrus)

Currently, it replaces all setPlaceholder calls to Papyrus's multi-source parser and prefixes all placeholder identifiers with "papi"
e.g. instead of %player_name% you would write %papi_player_name%.
